My name is Tatjana Smiljanic and I come from Bosnia and Herzegovina. At this moment, I am studying a master's in History at University of Vienna with key research areas:

- Economic and Social History
- Women's and Gender History

Actually, this is a second master's degree. In 2008, I finished a master's in Economics at University of Belgrade.
My hobbies are reading interesting books, yoga, tasting delicious food and travel.
