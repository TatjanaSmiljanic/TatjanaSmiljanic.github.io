title: L10 Text to Map (1/2)
subtitle: Merging & Mapping
---

In this lesson we should prepare data for our final mapping in `QGIS`.

The preparation of data and final results have following steps:
 1) Collecting all toponyms
 2) Reformatting Getty Geographical Thesaurus (from XML)
 3) Matching collected geographical data with Getty Gazetteer
 4) Final results in `QGIS`.

## Collecting all toponyms

        f9.write(header+"\n".join(top_TSV))
    #print(counter) 

#generate("186") and using our function for different years

generate("1861")
generate("1862")
generate("1863")
generate("1864")
generate("1865")
