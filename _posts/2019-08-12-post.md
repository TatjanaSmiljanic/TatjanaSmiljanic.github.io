# Topic modeling the “Dispatch” folder

In this lesson we learn how to find most important topics in order to analyse data. However, the python notebook with python should help us to organize our data in order to prepare data our analysis. Our task is with using the provided R-script, run topic modelling on the “Dispatch" folder. 

# Jupyter notebook:

# Dispatch 1864 20 topics:

Please find the python code for 20 topics.
```
# %%time
# # Build LDA model
# number_of_topics = 20
# lda_model = gensim.models.LdaModel(corpus=corpus,
#                                    id2word=dictionary,
#                                    num_topics=number_of_topics,
#                                    update_every=20,
#                                    passes=100,
#                                    alpha='auto')
# print("-"*50)
# path = "./models_new/"
# lda_model.save(path+'dispatch_1864_20.lda')
```

 Data shows that dominant topics was 
In order analyse our data, we should make some adjustment in the python srcipt for 30 and later for 40 topics. 

# Dispatch 1864 30 topics:

```
# %%time
# # Build LDA model
# number_of_topics = 30
# lda_model = gensim.models.LdaModel(corpus=corpus,
#                                    id2word=dictionary,
#                                    num_topics=number_of_topics,
#                                    update_every=20,
#                                    passes=100,
#                                    alpha='auto')
# print("-"*50)
# path = "./models_new/"
# lda_model.save(path+'dispatch_1864_30.lda')
```

# Dispatch 1864 40 topics:

The anylsis shows that most important topics were enemy, army and general for topics 20 and 40. The most important topics for 30 topics were states,south, state etc.
