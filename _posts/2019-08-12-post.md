# Dispatch 1864 20 topics:

Please find the python code for 20 topics.
```
# %%time
# # Build LDA model
# number_of_topics = 20
# lda_model = gensim.models.LdaModel(corpus=corpus,
#                                    id2word=dictionary,
#                                    num_topics=number_of_topics,
#                                    update_every=20,
#                                    passes=100,
#                                    alpha='auto')
# print("-"*50)
# path = "./models_new/"
# lda_model.save(path+'dispatch_1864.lda')
```

In order to see changes we should make some changes in python code for 30 and later for 40 topics. Detailed explanation is just for 
30 topics.

# Dispatch 1864 30 topics:

```
# %%time
# # Build LDA model
# number_of_topics = 30
# lda_model = gensim.models.LdaModel(corpus=corpus,
#                                    id2word=dictionary,
#                                    num_topics=number_of_topics,
#                                    update_every=20,
#                                    passes=100,
#                                    alpha='auto')
# print("-"*50)
# path = "./models_new/"
# lda_model.save(path+'dispatch_1864.lda')
