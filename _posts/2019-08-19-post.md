subtitle: Gephi

The two basically scripts for Social Network Analysis I explained in previous post. Here, I would like to explain how I made 
my SNA analysis with Gephi.

For our Gephi project, we need to have two files:
1) Edges file  ( with source, target and weight) *dispatch_toponymsID_1861.tsv*
2) Nodes file (with ID, label, lat, ion) *nodes_dispatch_toponymsID_1861.tsv*
