title: L13 Social Network Analysis (SNA) 2/2
subtitle: Gephi

The two basically scripts for Social Network Analysis I explained in previous post. Here, I would like to explain how I made 
my SNA analysis with Gephi.

For our Gephi project, we need to have two files:
1) Edges file  ( with source, target and weight) *dispatch_toponymsID_1861.tsv*
2) Nodes file (with ID, label, lat, ion) *nodes_dispatch_toponymsID_1861.tsv*


Please find the results in Gephi with Geo Loayout plugin.

It is very important that in Gephi we set up our layout with plugin Geo Layout which had  latitude (lat) and longitude(lon) for our network analysis.
